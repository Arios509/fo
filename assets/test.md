# iPhone 11

## It just got a whole lot harder to take a bad photo.
**All‑new dual‑camera system.** Take your photos from wide to ultra‑wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective.

## “Okay, everyone, scooch out a bit.”

**New Ultra Wide camera.**Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures 4x more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And holiday shots that show the whole family — including the views you travelled 18,000 kilometres for.
